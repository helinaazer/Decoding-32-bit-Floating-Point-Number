# Decoding-32-bit-Floating-Point-Number
A program in 68k assembly language to decode an IEEE 32-bit floating point number given as a decimal into sign bit, exponent bits, and mantissa bits.

The program starts at memory location $4000.
It prompts the user to Enter a number in decimal.
The user is able to enter an integer(in decimal).
After getting the input from the user, save the input number into a variable that is defined.

The program prints our the sign bit("+" or "-"), exponent bit(in decimal) and mantissa(in decimal).
